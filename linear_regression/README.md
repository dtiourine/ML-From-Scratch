# Linear Regression Regression from Scratch

## Overview

This directory contains the implementation of linear regression from scratch in Python. Linear regression is a fundamental regression algorithm used for predicting continuous values. 

## Implementation 

* linear_regression_model.py: Contains the implementation of the linear regression model class.
* data_loader.py: Code for loading and preprocessing the dataset used for training and testing.
* train_linear_regression.py: Code for training the linear regression model on the training set.
* evaluate_linear_regression.py: Code for evaluating the trained model's performance on the test set.
* saved_trained_model/trained_diabetes_model.pkl: Saved model

## Dataset

The dataset used to train/test this model was scikit-learn diabetes dataset, obtained from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html
