# RNN from Scratch for Sentiment Analysis 

## Project Overview

This project aims to deepen the understanding of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by implementing an RNN from scratch in Python. The primary task is sentiment analysis, focusing on classifying text data (such as movie reviews) into positive or negative sentiments.

## Objectives

* To implement the fundamental components of an RNN, including forward propagation and backpropagation through time (BPTT).
* To apply the RNN model to a real-world task - sentiment analysis of text data.

## Dataset 

The project uses the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset, a standard benchmark in sentiment analysis. The dataset comprises movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative.
