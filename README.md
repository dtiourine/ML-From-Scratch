# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

## Overview

This project aims to implement various machine learning models from scratch to gain a better understanding of the underlying algorithms and principles that power popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. By building these models manually, I aim to enhance my knowledge and intuition about how these models work "under the hood."

## Motivation 

Machine learning libraries offer powerful tools for building and deploying machine learning models quickly and efficiently. However, to become proficient in machine learning, it's crucial to have a deep understanding of the algorithms and techniques behind these libraries. This project serves as a learning exercise to:

 * Understand the fundamental principles of machine learning algorithms.
 * Gain hands-on experience in implementing and training models.
 * Explore the inner workings of algorithms like linear regression and logistic regression.

## Implemented Models

Currently, the following machine learning models have been implemented in this project:

* Logistic Regression
