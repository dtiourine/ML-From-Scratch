# Logistic Regression from Scratch

## Overview

This directory contains the implementation of logistic regression from scratch in Python. Logistic regression is a widely used classification algorithm that is fundamental to many machine learning tasks. This implementation is designed for educational purposes and provides insights into the inner workings of logistic regression.

## Implementation 

* logistic_regression_model.py: Contains the implementation of the logistic regression model class.
* data_loader.py: Code for loading and preprocessing the dataset used for training and testing.
* train_logistic_regression.py: Code for training the logistic regression model on the training set.
* evaluate_logistic_regression.py: Code for evaluating the trained model's performance on the test set.
* saved_trained_model/trained_iris_model.pkl: Saved model

  ## Dataset

  The dataset used to train/test this model was The Iris Dataset, obtained from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html
