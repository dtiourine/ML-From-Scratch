# Logistic Regression from Scratch

## Overview

This directory contains the implementation of logistic regression from scratch in Python. Logistic regression is a widely used classification algorithm that is fundamental to many machine learning tasks. This implementation is designed for educational purposes and provides insights into the inner workings of logistic regression.

## Implementation 

* logistic_regression_model.py: This file contains the implementation of the logistic regression model class.
* data_loader.py: Code for loading and preprocessing the dataset used for training.
* train_logistic_regression.py: The main script for training the logistic regression model.
* evaluate_logistic_regression.py: Code for evaluating the trained model's performance.
